When selecting a file or folder, the program will automatically create a disk image of the specified type (from Preferences), prompting the user for a location if necessary. </p>									<p class="body">A preference can be made to set the action to be taken on the opening of an ISO or Disk Image. This includes mounting (the default), burning, converting, verifying, and other options.</p>									<p class="body"><b>											Open on launch<br>										</b></p>									<p class="body">Users can open FreeDMG by dropping a file or folder on top of the FreeDMG icon (either in the Finder, or from the Dock). The software also has the ability to quit after opening on launch - this makes it convenient to use FreeDMG as a disk image &quot;droplet&quot; - opening up to image the provided items, and quitting to keep system memory use low. </p>									<p class="body"><b>	New blank images<br>										</b></p>									<p class="body">FreeDMG can create new UDIF (read/write) or SPARSE (expandable read/write) images of a specified size. Users can invoke this command under File -&gt; New. Mac OS 10.5 introduces the ability to save disk images as &quot;sparsebundles&quot;, which are the recommended sparsetype for that platform. Sparsebundles are not available in Mac OS X v.10.3 or 10.4.</p>									<p class="body">Users can specify an image's volume name when creating images from scratch.

This may not be recommended, depending on your use. To create cross-platform images, the &quot;Make Hybrid&quot; option should be chosen from underneath the &quot;Images&quot; menu. See the Make Hybrid section below.<br>										<br>										<b> Image from folder<br>										</b></p>									<p class="body">The best way to create custom disk images is to use the &quot;Image from Folder&quot; command from underneath the &quot;Images&quot; menu. Please note that this command be used to image folders as well as volumes. It may be recommended to use the &quot;Image from Device&quot; option when creating images from bootable disks, but &quot;Image from Volume&quot; (which uses Image from Folder) can be just as effective (and will preserve permissions).</p>									<p class="body"><b>	Scrub image<br>										</b></p>									<p class="body">When a disk image is created, certain Finder attributes, stored in the '.DS_Store' file are removed. This is called &quot;scrubbing&quot; of the image. This is done to eliminate the amount of personal information that is disclosed (in invisible files!!!) when creating electronic media that may be publicly distributed. This can also eliminate some attributes that user wish to preserve. The default is to scrub images - this feature can be disabled in FreeDMG preferences.</p>									<p class="body"><b>	Image from Volume<br>										</b></p>									<p class="body">This command creates a disk image from a volume or other mounted disk. The &quot;Image from Folder&quot; command is actually used for this function. Permissions should be preserved when using either method.</p>									<p class="body"><b>	Image from Device<br>										</b></p>									<p class="body">Image from device may be the most comprehensive disk image function - this should preserve the partition map of the device specified. All permissions should be preserved, as this image is done by block copy.</p>									<p class="body"><b>Limit segments to size<br>										</b></p>									<p class="body">The &quot;Limit segments to size&quot; preference is only available with the &quot;Image from Device&quot; command. For some reason, this option is specified for both device/folder imaging, but only works on devices (in 10.4 - not tested in 10.5).<br>										<br>										<b>Converting disk images<br>										</b><br>										<b>		Image formats<br>										</b><br>										 UDRW - UDIF read/write image<br>										 UDRO - UDIF read-only image<br>										 UDCO - UDIF ADC-compressed image<br>										 UDZO - UDIF zlib-compressed image<br>										 UDBZ - UDIF bzip2-compressed image (OS X 10.4+ only)<br>										 UFBI - UDIF entire image with MD5 checksum<br>										 UDRo - UDIF read-only (obsolete format)<br>										 UDCo - UDIF compressed (obsolete format)<br>										 UDTO - DVD/CD-R master for export<br>										 UDxx - UDIF stub image<br>										 UDSP - SPARSE (grows with content)<br>										 UDSB - SPARSEBUNDLE (grows with content; bundle-backed)<br>										 RdWr - NDIF read/write image (deprecated)<br>										 Rdxx - NDIF read-only image (Disk Copy 6.3.3 format)<br>										 ROCo - NDIF compressed image (deprecated)<br>										 Rken - NDIF compressed (obsolete format)<br>										 DC42 - Disk Copy 4.2 image<br>										<br>										 In addition to the compression offered by some formats, the<br>										 UDIF and NDIF read-only formats completely remove unused space<br>										in HFS and UFS filesystems.  For UDZO, the zlib compression level can be spec-<br>										ified.  The default compression level is 1 (fastest).<br>										<br>										<b>Image modification<br>										</b><br>										<b>Resize</b><br>										<br>										Resize a disk image or the containers within it.  Given a<br>										 read/write partitioned UDIF, if the last partition is<br>										 Apple_HFS, attempt to resize the partition to the end of the<br>										 image, or to the last used block in the embedded HFS/HFS+<br>										 filesystem (depending on size_spec). On older systems, resize<br>										 was limited to pre-defined limits that depended on how the<br>										filesystem was created.  As of OS X 10.4, resize can be used<br>										 to grow an HFS filesystem within an image to any size sup-<br>										 ported by HFS and the filesystem hosting the image.<br>										<br>										 resize is often used when a device image needs to be shrunk so<br>										 that the HFS/HFS+ partition can be converted to CD-R/DVD-R<br>										format and still be burned.  Note that gaps cannot be<br>										reclaimed as resize does not move data.  -fsargs can sometimes<br>										be used to minimize filesystem-generated gaps.  resize can<br>										 grow a filesystem and image within the bounds of the image and<br>										 filesystem formats (e.g. roughly 2^63 bytes for HFS+ inside of<br>										 a UDRW on HFS+).<br>										<br>										<br>										<b>Compress</b><br>										<br>											Scans the bands of a sparse (SPARSE or SPARSEBUNDLE) disk<br>										 image containing an HFS filesystem, removing those parts of<br>										 the image which are no longer being used by the filesystem.<br>										 Depending on the location of files in the hosted filesystem,<br>										compact may or may not shrink the image.  For SPARSEBUNDLE<br>										 images, completely unused band files are simply removed.<br>										<br>										<br>										<b>		Change password<br>										</b><br>											Change the passphrase for an encrypted image.

The gener-<br>										 ated image can later be burned using burn, or converted to<br>										another read-only format with convert.  By default, the<br>										 filesystem will be readable on most modern computing plat-<br>										forms.  The generated filesystem is not intended for conver-<br>										 sion to read/write, but can safely have its files copied to a<br>										 read/write filesystem by ditto(8) or asr(8) (in file-copy<br>										 mode).<br>										<br>										 hdiutil supports generating El Torito-style bootable ISO9660<br>										 filesystems, which is commonly used for booting x86-based<br>										 hardware. The specification includes several emulation modes.<br>										 By default, an El Torito boot image emulates either a 1.2MB,<br>										 1.44MB, or 2.88MB floppy drive, depending on the size of the<br>										image.  Also available are &quot;No Emulation&quot; and &quot;Hard Disk<br>										Emulation&quot; modes, which allow the boot image to either be<br>										 loaded directly into memory, or be virtualized as a parti-<br>										 tioned hard disk, respectively. The El Torito options should<br>										 not be used for data CDs.<br>										<br>										<b>		Add SLA<br>										</b><br>										Add software license agreements to the resource fork of the <br>											selected image.
