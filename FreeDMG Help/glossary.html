These images can be mounted on most modern computing platforms, including BSD, Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.</td>										</tr>										<tr>											<td>Image on the fly</td>											<td></td>											<td>A method of disk imaging in FreeDMG that allows the user to quickly image a dropped folder or file without having the software prompt for information on how to create the image. Image options are derived from preferences.</td>										</tr>										<tr>											<td>Internet enabled disk images</td>											<td></td>											<td>An internet enabled disk image allows web browsers such as Safari to automatically mount downloaded disk images, and copy the image's contents to the location that it was downloaded to, discarding the image afterwards.</td>										</tr>										<tr>											<td>Journaled HFS+</td>											<td></td>											<td>A volume format introduced in Mac OS 10.2.2 was the Journaled HFS+ format, which provides increased data reliability.</td>										</tr>										<tr>											<td>MS-DOS (filesystem)</td>											<td></td>											<td>The FAT16 volume format as implemented in Mac OS X.</td>										</tr>										<tr>											<td>Mount</td>											<td></td>											<td>Mount a disk image or volume.

Segmented disk images must have all segments intact, and reside in the same folder as the rest of the segments when mounting.</td>										</tr>										<tr>											<td>Software License Agreement</td>											<td></td>											<td>A software license agreement binds a user to terms under which the software can be used. Generally, this license is presented before the first use of the software. Using FreeDMG, SLAs can be attached so that the user must agree to the terms of the provided license before gaining acess to the software.</td>										</tr>										<tr>											<td>Sparse Bundle</td>											<td></td>											<td>Similar to a sparse image, this bundle-style disk image incorporates informational plist files and sparse disk images into a single package.
